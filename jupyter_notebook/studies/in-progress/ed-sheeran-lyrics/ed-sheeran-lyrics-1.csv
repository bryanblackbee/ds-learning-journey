lyrics|title
   Come on now Dry your eyes I'm sick of all your lies I've grown to despise you  Already sick of what you're saying Hoping now I'm only praying My baby's gone away And I've already packed my bags  You didn't know me (I've run away) You couldn't show me (What you have to say) My one and only Has gone away  Far away  You'll never leave me alone Now I'm off on my own I'll never ring your phone again  And still you keep on crying If I said I loved you I'd be lying You need to dry your eyes And I've still gone to pack my bags  You didn't know me (I've run away) You couldn't show me (What you have to say) My one and only Has gone away  You didn't know me (I've run away) You couldn't show me (What you have to say) My one and only Has gone away  Far away |moody-ballad-of-ed
   Well, I've walked this street Well, I've walked this street before And everyone's locked up their door 'Cos they heard me coming And I've been running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she's cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery You said we went too fast And you said we wouldn't last Now I've put the past behind me And I'm running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery It's taken you a long time to see In misery And everyone's locked up their door 'Cos they heard me coming And I've been running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she's cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery You said we went too fast And you said we wouldn't last Now I've put the past behind me And I'm running From what I don't know if she's there Or if she cares It's taken you a long time to see You've got a goldfish memory This song's for you, not for me In misery It's taken you a long time to see In misery |misery
   Strings on my guitar are rusty Even my best friends don't trust me Everybody thinks I must be crazy 'Cos, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) 'Cos, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) Everything's in a haze Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze Everything's blurry Oh, what's happened to me? Say, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) Now, I'm your typical average teen If you know what I mean (Typical average teen) |typical-average
   I think I took too much I'm addicted to your touch But I'm crying In shame again And now I'm high as a kite And I know I might be gone When you get home Oh well, we've come this far You're my Venus And I'm your Mars And we've passed the moon and stars And I'm gone But now I'm high as a kite And I know I'm might be gone When you get home I'm high as a kite And I know I'm almost gone When you get home So please come home |addicted
   I'm standing on a mountain Waiting for you to come You were sitting counting The days that I had gone The note I wrote I wrapped up in a cigarette Burned away the memories I tried to forget But not yet Wishing my life away But these three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true I love you I love you How can I tell you? I don't know what to say This chance that I won't miss But I miss you anyway I feel your pain It's turning me insane Thrown away I had to take the last train home  But then you came Wishing my life away But these three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true I love you Wishing my life away These three words I have to say to you My baby blue You know it's true You know it's true I love you I love you I love you |i-love-you
   Canât get you off my mind Look at me and you will find Time after time it seems Iâll say what I donât mean  In your world we were the same In mine now youâre the one to blame You canât remember my name Weâre lost, itâs such a shame  Listen to me Stop making me see What Iâve been waiting for Listen to me Stop making me see  Iâm strong yet proud Iâm quiet yet loud And Iâm everything You want in me Iâm small yet tall I have it all And Iâm everything You want me to be  Listen to me Stop making me see What Iâve been waiting for Listen to me Stop making me see  And I still feel like I need you still And I still feel like Iâm on some pill And I still feel like I need you still  Listen to me Stop making me see What Iâve been waiting for Listen to me Making me see |open-your-ears
   Just lay it all down on me Itâs getting harder for me to breathe Just want to know if it will be Just want to know if it is me  And you know Iâve learned from my mistakes And how much have I got to lose? You find my heart is hard to break Canât keep playing the fool  Breathe in, exhale To turn to move beyond the pale Flag up, set sail To find whatâs there beyond the pale  I feel like Iâve gone to the end of the world What do I have to do?  You know Iâve learned from my mistakes How much have I got to lose? You find my heart hard to break Canât keep playing the fool  Breathe in, exhale To turn to move beyond the pale Flag up, set sail To find whatâs there beyond the pale  What can I do Just to let you know That youâre in my mind? To try and justify The way you liberate me Every time |beyond-the-pale
   I write this song in memory of The wayward smile The boy we wonât forget The soul you took away from us The river flows The tears that we wept  Missing you Is all that needs to be said More than blue The words inside my head  And I know that youâre gone  The cheeky smile Of jokes and laughs The memories of times We crossed the line The stepping stones Across my mind Washed away We all now feel so blind  Missing you Is all that needs to be said More than blue The words inside my head  And I know that youâre gone  Goodbye |in-memory
   Iâm getting very edgy Cos youâre trying to take this from me And itâs something that I wanted so bad Cos youâre the definition Of someone who has to ruin The best thing that I ever had Cos youâre a jealous girl And all I can say is Itâs your fault but partially mine For losing hope For not treating you right But that will disappear in time  All I gotta do is pass you by Never say whatâs wrong Whenever I say why?  Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? Iâm losing sleep I live only for the week  Iâve grown to ignore you Cos when I seem to bore you You pretend that youâre not interested Your eyes start to twinkle Your smile starts to widen And I just seem to try and forget But you pay me no attention Even though I do But I donât care as long as youâre mine Itâs happening every time  All I gotta do is pass you by Never say whatâs wrong Whenever I say why?  Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? Iâm losing sleep I live only for the week  And Iâm falling harder now it seems My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams And I canât sleep although I think I can Itâs insomnia I think I have But who cares when Iâm not your man?  Standing in the corner Shadowed by the light To you I seem much smaller But I know it might be you How much better could I do To be myself, not someone else? Iâm losing sleep I live only for the week |insomniacs-lullaby
   In shadow there lies hope Cut tension with a knife I find it hard to cope Stop playing with my life You analyze my fears Analyze my dreams Choke on burning tears Through my silent screams  Things aren't what they seem  Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better  Watch me fall As I stumble at your feet Always losing in this game Your lies cut me deep And you don't even know my name With your consistency To always watch me crawl And my durability Not affected at all  Still things aren't what they seem  Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better  Feel the pain On my brain Feel the strain As I start to decay Feel the strain Every passing day Feel the pain As I start to decay  Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me Tell this army of angels to make me breathe Open doors just to take away the key I'll let you all see that I'm doing better |quiet-ballad-of-ed
   Iâm screaming out upon my face Followed footsteps catch my pace Broken windows fall in place Now shattered lovers find their place  Weâd flirt And youâd treat me like dirt All the pain and the hurt Just to make matters worse  And I see you all over him Irresistible sin When can we be the same again? What can I do to be making you see? To come out clean? Youâre better off with me  Weâre stuck Taking time and wasting mine No luck Running around and crashing down In you I trust nevermore Leaving you in sand and glass  All I ever felt for you Went up in a cloud of smoke How I could I be such a fool To ever think that we were close?  And I see you all over him Irresistible sin When can we be the same again? What can I do to be making you see? To come out clean? Youâre better off with me  Weâre stuck Taking time and wasting mine No luck Running around and crashing down In you I trust nevermore Leaving you in sand and glass |no-luck
   Stevie was a boy Who turned into a man He never had no master plan But I knew that he could Find right from wrong Sing me a different song He told me which road to take And now Iâm gone  Keep on singing Make her life whole Stevie youâre winning And I just feel cold Take your life beyond the mark You can do no wrong When I lose my way in the dark Keep singing your song  Please come follow me I find it hard to breathe Please come follow me I find it hard to breathe |stevensong
   Mr Ruskin come and paint my picture Weâre losing sleep 'cos we steal the week Now whoâs your best friend? Can you introduce me? See I canât seem to even let you breathe  When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own And I am my own best friend and I need me to see That I am more than what is hiding in me  Come and show me if you can See I know youâre me But I canât seem to understand If you know me, place my hand on mine And we will resurrect the time That we lost when you left my mind Itâs psycho-paranoia disappearing in time Come and show me what makes you tick I need you to get out of my mind quick  When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mindâs eye Please let me forget that Iâm standing on my own And I am my own best friend and I need me to see That I am more than what is hiding in me |billy-ruskin
   Take me with you I do declare I love you dearly through here and there What can I do to make you share? What can I do to make you care?  The world is harsh Iâm stuck in the dark Iâll make my mark Iâve got my spark  Weâd be together through bad or worse Sending letters we shall converse We could do better but we must first Make amends That depends Will you be my friend?  The world is harsh Iâm stuck in the dark Iâll make my mark Iâve got my spark |spark
   You know I got to get away To find some peace and sanity Iâve been playing hide-and-seek too long Shaking, making, everybody waking Setting the hi-fi bleed Keeping me back While youâre spinning my track Thatâll knock you off your feet  Monkey see what monkey do But Iâm a monkey telling you I just think that we should take a break Tickity-tock the clock With the hip-hop And alonestar backing me up We wonât stop I gotta be searching for my peace of mind Now let the track rewind  And play, let the music play It came, so let the music say what it feels Shame, shame it took too long To see that you were wrong Now turn the song back on  This is Alonestar coming at you With a new style Kicking dust Ready to bust It's Urban Angel Artistic, flipping the script Who d'you really want to get it with? Ed and Alonestar We're like live wires sparking Ready to blow We've already sown our seeds We're just waiting to grow - blow We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body Metaphorical speech when we come and see You ducking for cover Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock With Urban Angel and Alonestar And Ed - keep it locked Let the beat pump Drop the bass but don't stop We're kicking the sound Let the bass bins pound We're gonna roll Can you feel me now with my body? Get down to the sound It's Ed Sheeran in the place And Alonestar rising up We gotta rise up I said rise up  And play, let the music play It came, so let the music say what it feels Shame, shame it took so long To see that you were wrong Now turn the song back on |pause
   Pass me a drink You say itâs gonna take a while Your consciousness sinks Tears from a crocodile  Youâre wasting your time Giving me the speech You try to, donât reach Your smile  Youâre holding your tears Your inside is dead Youâre eating your fears In a cigarette  Youâve waited too long To finally see The sunshine in the rain Is as deep as the sea  Iâve taken the blow Itâs all down on paper Had fun in the snow But no âsee you laterâ  Youâre wasting your time Giving me the speech You try to, donât reach Your smile  Youâre holding your tears Your inside is dead Youâre eating your fears In a cigarette  Youâve waited too long To finally see The sunshine in the rain Is as deep as the sea |the-sea
   Well I once heard a story about a run-down home Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone He tried to live, no effort was shown Heâs slowly finding a way back home  He had a family with smiles and frowns They never could solve his way to be down Cos heâs one dog who donât want a bone Heâs slowly finding a way back home  He had a nice house with windows and doors He said to his wife whatâs mine is yours But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown Heâs slowly finding a way back home  His children have left but the rooms are still there His misses the noise and the scents in their hair But far from the nest the babies have flown Heâs slowly finding a way back home  His wife was an angel sent from above He never returned her kisses or love But soon heâd found that sheâd overgrown This man whoâs finding a way back home  So the leaves are all dead in this broken manâs June The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon He stares at the floor, no more to roam Heâs slowly finding a way back home  Well I once heard a story about a run-down home Where a man with regrets lived all alone He tried to live, no effort was shown Heâll never find a way back home |way-home
   I want to be real Not some conscience to myself The way you worship, never ending Some idol whoâs pretending to be true How you put upon yourself A man who never seems To answer to you words So go and make me over  Iâm a fly upon your neck You canât control me I have my words, my voice My strengths, my choice And I can cut as deep Just as deep as I need  Donât want your advice Cos Iâve made up my own mind The way you bore me with the stories Of far and distant times Iâve heard it before So donât try that on me The way you worship, never-ending Some idol whoâs pretending to be true It could be you Brainwashed by the lies Itâs no surprise That youâd wanna waste your time  Iâm a fly upon your neck You canât control me I have my words, my voice My strengths, my choice And I can cut as deep Just as deep as I need |bonus-track
   Well my friend it seems weâve come too far to disagree My knees feel weak and I fell too fast The tide is high but we swam in too deep To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece You can take away all this mess And I could never think anything less of you  âCos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all I have left  The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms To spur this on we left that room too long You open wide and all the lies flow out To eat you whole But we both know that youâre too cold And she said âI can put away all those lies And show you thereâs no surprise in meâ  Well still, you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all that I have left  Exorcise these demons But they keep talking to me I am no believer But I believe you will relieve me I believe you will relieve me And thatâs whatâs going on  âCos you break me You numb me You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me You are all that I have left  You break me |you-break-me
   Itâs been a while since we were here Been too long my fear is Holding back the memories of your eyes Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me All thatâs left is shattered hearts Itâs plain enough for us to see that Youâve got me Youâve got me  Weâre just friends tangled up in loose ends I feel it coming around again Let me know where you let your heart go And I will just pretend That I have never felt this way Since you I have never felt this way Since you I feel strange Playing games Itâs no fuss Iâm not in love  Twisted tunes, a melody of spite If you give me the words then I might Let go unknown feelings Telling me that I cannot fight When you speak that shite Let go unknown feelings Telling me that Youâve got me Youâve got me  Weâre just friends tangled up in loose ends I feel it coming around again Let me know where you let your heart go And I will just pretend That I have never felt this way Since you I have never felt this way Since you I feel strange Playing games Itâs no fuss Iâm not in love  I lost it in your kiss, your lips, Sweetness, in your smile Your words make me whole But your scars demand a healerâs touch Itâs true Iâm glad Iâm not you |im-glad-im-not-you
   Well I walked from my house to yours In a warm cold April rain We barely went outdoors And your family took the blame Take time to be with you She can only glare Iâm a bad influence, thatâll do âCos I need to cut my hair Wash my mouth, change my clothes Just donât talk to those friends of yours Tell them not to come here anymore Time to go, donât be slow Thisâll only take a moâ Take yourself right out of my door  Itâs just that they donât care Dad said beware, watch your back Just donât reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And donât give in to lust And leave that one alone The girlâs trouble  Time spent in burnt-down shed Add up near two days Fall down and cut my head Take time to misbehave Spend time and be with you She can only glare âCos youâre a bad influence, thatâll do Boy you need to cut your hair Wash your mouth, change your clothes Just donât talk to those friends of yours Tell them not to come here anymore Time to go, donât be slow Thisâll only take a moâ Take yourself right out of my door  Itâs just that they donât care Dad said beware, watch your back Just donât reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And donât give in to lust And leave that one alone  This is the dancing song Close your eyes Hypnotise to the beat And the movement of the week Do that shuffle of your feet And pound out the fever, either Dance as youâre a true believer Cleaner lives are what you donât see Fell the weight, gravitate Feel the pace of me This world is 2D The only thing thatâs free in life is love And that donât come cheap  Itâs just that they donât care Dad said beware, watch your back Just donât reply to that woman there And even if she makes a fuss Just ignore that trust And donât give in to lust And leave that one alone The girlâs trouble |you-need-to-cut-your-hair
   Sara, what you do to me is enlighten my mind Oh wow, I said Sara, what you do to me is make my soul unwind  Hey now âCos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue Half the guys I know are after you Cheer me up when I'm in a mood So I thought I'd write a song for you  And may I say, you look like an angel today May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays If only to make you smile today âCos you are great, I thought I'd say that  Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock Behind a can of Strongbow Oh wow, I said Sara, you say that you don't look good when you do Even with that soul  Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue Half the guys I know are after you Cheer me up when I'm in a mood So I thought I'd write a song for you  And may I say, you look like an angel today May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays If only to make you smile today âCos you are great, I thought I'd say that  May I say, you look great May I play this to make your day |sara
   Now it seems Iâve been young, dug my hole in the ground To me thereâs only up, there ainât no point in looking down However hard I try, I only get weaker Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold  What you gotta do is never get yourself down Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground Keep out of trouble, ainât no trouble being pure Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now  Move on, forget it Now move on, forget it  When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody Hennesey shots and glocks, all these fools on the block Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top? I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy With my head in the sky Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die So see the signs, stand to the side Open your eyes and take a look and realise The resurrection's arrived And as the mist clears, homie I arise From my tomb in disguise I'm all alone, Alonestar Urban Angel rising from the ashes Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move Now back up!  Move on, forget it Now move on, forget it  All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who â¦what the fuck does it matter? Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder It don't matter to me All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, can you hear me? |move-on
   I felt the fall on my breast At the bottom of my stomach She put my hand on her chest While she looked into my eyes You rescued me And called up these words in threes And you know I canât forget it And 10 months on you liberate truth See, I was wrong on how I hate you And itâs the worst thing that I did  When I read through you You werenât translated So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages So Iâd be free from it  See, all this truth sparks lies in me Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy The key is just to ignore Even if this time has made me unsure And 12 months on Iâm back in my mood See, I got drunk and said I loved you And itâs the worst thing that I did  When I read through you You werenât translated So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages So Iâd be free from it |yellow-pages
   Just give me a pen and Iâll write my worries Now and again Iâll try and not see that you donât care Taking the time to taste and savour Lifeâs bitter wine and childish behaviour But you donât care  And hey, I donât speak that language of youth And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth And hey, I lay in this world for a while When all is lost just smile  Theyâve written the dates and the times to follow See all the fakes that look so hollow But you donât care What ever happened to the youth and culture? Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper So you donât care  And hey, I donât speak that language of youth And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth And hey, I lay in this world for a while When all is lost just smile |smile

Replace, she was so unforgiving And Iâm so frustrated, so dilated And sheâs telling me Iâve wasted my time And Iâm running back like, just to face the facts right To tell me your voice takes me through the night  Your smile and your memory Simply eases me to sleep In my ear while the whispering Melts my heart on every beat  Still youâre singing lullabies and postcards to this place And weâre asking for so much more Now youâre bringing smiles and laughter to this face While bad memories are in pieces on the floor  Face me, are you tired of living?

   Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief Memories I have of you Won't leave me in peace My mind was running back To the west coast of Clare Thinking of you And the times we had there  I walked to Spanish Point I knew I'd find you there I stood on the white strand You were everywhere Vivid memories fade But the mood still remains I wish I could go back And be with you again  In Milltown there's a pub Itâs there that I sat down I see you everywhere Your face is all around The search for times past Contains such sweet pain I'll banish lonesome thoughts But theyâll return again  I walk along the shore The rain in my face My mind is numb with grief Of you there is no trace I'll think of this again In far off lands I roam Walking with you By this cold Atlantic fog  Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief Memories I have of you Won't leave me in peace My mind was running back To the west coast of Clare Thinking of you And the times we had there |the-west-coast-of-clare
   I found the words to say how I feel But I just canât spell them I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field So you can tell them That Iâm a different man with a different tune I didnât find love until last June But I lost it, just like I lost it all I tried to use it to break my fall âCos I need something, anything to replace you Or something close |i-cant-spell

"  [Ed:] I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe. Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon 'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine ""'Cause real will recognise real"" is what my father says And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.  [Devlin:] 5 o'clock with lights off Interview with a vampire Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying 'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game It's time to wage war Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives 2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes, Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by  [Chorus:] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... The times I'm living in lately.  [Ed:] I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out Deliver the raps how I flow I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die. Never die.  [Devlin:] 2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze, Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do, Driven young gentlemen I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true! I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got, I keep my pupils engaged, Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.  [Chorus:] I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be, The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...

   These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute? The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots  Whats better than thinking about the ones you love Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan No one here to save the day now you're all alone Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone  [Chorus] And when the sun falls down I'll be up again I never close my eyes, And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when) My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)  I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one I know your proud staring at your grandson I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I like Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin' And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must now I gotta fly My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock, I don't stop at night.

   Hmm let me go, To see my family. Please, Father, let me go, As my mother sleeps.  Life  I don't know about James Bond, But 'round here nobody live twice. When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye, 'Cause only a judge can give you life. (Get it?) This is my advice, Trust me, I nearly lost my life. 3 weeks after I got this ride Pissed like I had way too much wine. I wished that I didn't get one, Anyway, I was going to the Macbeth booked for a set, Even though I didn't have a set one. Scream hit the decks, I was like check one. Put on a show, but it weren't my best one. Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination, Then I was off to the next one, 20 minutes later I was on the M1, Tired. But I kept on going, Fell asleep without even knowing. No emotion in my face, No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going. Woke up, Lorry, Flash, Panic, Break, Skid, Crash, Skidded, More, Bang, Smash, Out, Cold, Ribs, Cracked, Ouch. I was in so much pain, Crawled out of a Megane that now looked like a Mini, When I was still on the first lane. Baffled, didn't even know my name. Fainted, too much shock in my brain. Surrounded by paramedics and feds, Trying to get up but fainted again.  See, I just want you to take a second, hear me out. Don't think I'm happy 'cause I smile when you see me out. I've had serious madness is where I've nearly disappeared, Oh, I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, To see my family, And keep it inside, Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. Save my soul, Please, Father, let me go. Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps.  Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open, I can hear voices and my phone ringing. Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning, One of the worst situations I've been in. I can hear all of the angels singing.  But when it stopped humming, My brain turned on, started running. Still in pain, but it started numbing, The stone cold comeback I made was stunning. I still tried to do a few shows 'cause I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming. But I was left with a permanent problem, Nobody knows about the pain that I'm inside. Ever so cunning, 6 weeks later, jogging and running. I used the first aid kit like a drum set, Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming. Trust me, when it comes to mistakes, You can't afford to let one in. Never done dream for a while, The pipeline was blocked, So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing. They say tomorrow never dies, But he forgot to tell you you can. You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang, But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam. You can try beg for another, Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show, Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother', Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, Runner.  See, I just want you to take a second, hear me out. Don't think I'm happy 'cause I smile when you see me out. I've had serious madness is where I've nearly disappeared. Oh, I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go, To see my family. And keep it inside, Dry eyes, while my brother weeps. Save my soul, Please, Father, let me go. Keep me safe. âAs my mother sleeps  And let me go, to see my family And keep it inside, Dry eyes, while my brother weeps Save my soul, Please, Father, let me go And keep me safeâ |family
   Hi, my name is JME, there was a time when radio played me Cause my music came from my heart, it was real to me But now it's a par I'm here struggling, keeping it real, while the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal, Sometimes I sit back and think JME just do one tune, make a couple G's and chill, The reason I started making music is the exact same reason that I'll never do it, I swear I didn't go through all that for this I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is, unfair, straight Who could tell me different, look at me, determined, Man on a mission, my music is me, and I am my music So like it or lump it, I'm a do this  [Chorus:] I never had a playlist in my heart, oho Now I need an A list just to chart oho But I've been famous from the start oho How am I gonna make my mark? oho oh Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio I get in, forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oh, oh  Thank God for night clubs and the raves Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves Unless we water it down, but cordial music is boring me now I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is Or in this music scene, what your role is I'm still trying here, cause I'm a pioneer I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears See I'm just telling you the truth Can't shoot the messenger, bullet proof booth, You won't hear me on the radio, but go to the rave and the crowd, they're raising roof Why is that? What's going on there? To tell you the truth, I don't really care I am my music, my music is me Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be  [Chorus:] I never had a playlist in my heart, oho Now I need an A list just to chart oho But I've been famous from the start oho How am I gonna make my mark oho Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh, oho, oh  I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial Bleeding through the speakers, rhythm by the pile, So won't you hear me out? Never feel it from the base line, feel it in the club Maybe I could take time singing for the dub So won't you hear me out? Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh Are you gonna play me, though, this song was never meant for the radio I get in forget the radio spin, I'm just doing my thing, and I don't have time for a playlist How much will you pay me though? The song was not a hit on the radio, oho, oho, oho, oh. |radio
  [Mikill Pane:] Listen Little lady, this is just the worst way to spend your birthday It's 30 degrees, Thursday You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes Lady, the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try And you remember that your punter went crazy last night You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door But young woman The pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker Medical attention could be fatal 'Cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him 'Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in  [Ed Sheeran:] She's just under the upper hand And goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside, for angels to fly. For angels to fly.  [Mikill Pane:] Little lady, your mind you've made up Your injuries you can't hide with make-up You need some medical advice, you make up A little lie to say just In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip Last year when your pimp just lost it He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway 'Cause all the heroin is making you age But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag The funds you have left go where you're from using Moneygram Mother had to get you out the motherland to study That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand Little does she know you're never coming back She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan He's the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your Uncle, damn.  [Ed Sheeran:] She's just under the upper hand Goes mad for a couple grams And she don't wanna go outside, tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man It's too cold outside, for angels to fly Now an angel will die, covered in white With closed eyes and hoping for a better life This time, we'll fade out tonight, Straight down the line.  [Mikill Pane:] Little lady, you're trembling with fear Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it, She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you The same question he keeps trying to ask you, 'Who you working for?' He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore You're having a conversation you could be murdered for You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card Begs you to use it He's useless if you're gonna be stupid 'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat And then a voice says, 'Where you been bitch? I wanna know.' No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness You open the front door, he boots you in There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight At this point your life flashes before your eyes Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece And dumps her body in the boot of his Merc in the street. Little lady left this earth in the worst way All because she got a card on her 13th birthday  [Ed Sheeran:] And we're all under the upper hand And go mad for a couple grams And we don't wanna go outside, tonight. 'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and Sell love to another man. It's too cold outside, for angels to fly, for angels to fly, and fly fly, For angels to fly, to fly, to fly, angels to die |little-lady
   Iâm in so deep Omar Epps can relate to my situation on a real,  Pain ainât the emotion I wanna feel but Iâm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic Iâll be on a hill, keeping my head above water I canât afford to ever get caught in a corner So I move with the force of a sorcerer Itâs dark when Iâm about just me myself and my shadow I'm parro, running out of ammo, and it seems like everyone around me is on the same path so itâs narrow The less then the better, a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella I play fool to catch wise are they ever gonna guess I'm clever How can I be at my best with this pressure I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mindâs infected with terror No wonder Iâm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests I should of bust the back door and jump the fence It easy when you look back, shoulda, woulda, coulda but I bet you canât bring should woulda could back Back to fifteen I said to myself, that Iâm more than a hood track!  Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out You wonât drown me out, out, out You wonât drown me out  You canât ever drown me out, the water supplies too low And I'm around about 6'1, 10 stone I've never seen someone drown without, a sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs A violent MC, my mouth can vouch Do I sound like Iâm choking? Seriously, do I sound like Iâm joking? Iâm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean But I am a ship that's sunk many years, Iâm maintaining Plain sailing, no commotion Like a dolphin, when itâs in motion But i can't break me, so why would I show them Iâm broken No real shit, throw my skin ainât close to corrosion Fuck em all, this ain't tug of war, still don't get roped in the open, I donât wanna reveal my violent side But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign Then Iâma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you donât wanna see this guy survive.  Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out You wonât drown me out You wonât drown me out  Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out You wonât drown me out You wonât drown me out. |drown-me-out
   They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see And I vowed that my breathing will never cease To the retrieve then I can't let them be I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17 But I wasn't ready then like a lemon's green Now I'm in the magazines almost every week, Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife, Right now it's better than it's ever been Never fade like a plant that's evergreen It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me, Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak, Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be. They chase dreams together like a slumber party, And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in.  [Chorus:] When the darkness creeps in, I feel my nightmares watching me. And when my dreams are sleeping, I feel my nightmares watching me. Oh, oh, oh! I feel my nightmares watching me.  You better wake up cause I am making moves, And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules, I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training, Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze. Made my bed and that's where I'm heading, I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her Now I'm taking control of my inception, Cause they try to hit my misses with my erection, See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike, Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them. See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish The haters know where the family lives. Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger, Is gonna lose a lot more, than I need it. They say sleep is the cousin of death, But I hear shit, cousin I am deaf Gang signs I'm a N/A reading. I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next.  [Chorus:] When the darkness creeps in, I feel my nightmares watching me. And when my dreams are sleeping, I feel my nightmares watching me. Oh, oh, oh! I feel my nightmares watching me. They watching me! They watch me sleep!  Let me go! I fell asleep on sofa, woke up in reality, And daydream about losing my sanity. I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow. So I can see an off note with my eyes closed. But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat. I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep. See, all the dreams I'm fond of, You placed me in the team insomnia Now, I'm Mr hard worker, In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up, And I missed my chance worst luck, Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner Ch'yeah, but I walked from that ish, Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress.  [Chorus:] When the darkness creeps in, I feel my nightmares watching me. And when my dreams are sleeping, I feel my nightmares watching me. Oh, oh, oh! I feel my nightmares watching me. Watching me! |nightmares
   Hey... Can you hear me? I just wanted to let you know... Hmm...  I hope you can hear what I write to you How could I say goodbye to you? When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant 3 jobs in a day Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free Just locked in a cage slaving They said they were gold in the pavements But you came and saw the road to amazement Broke your heart But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast I hope your listening right I still think of you every Sunday No one can top your chicken and rice Even through the darkness times You held us all up because your vision was bright I knew your strength was your wisdom inside You never let anyone see your heartache You just got on with it Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful And your words you would stand strong with it Cause they were like warmth on a winter night But I was just too young to go on with it And there somethings I could try to do But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you.  And of the pieces of my soul... (Because I need a sign, I hope this pain will heal in time...) You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one...  I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...  I think you phoney I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now I would be by your side when you needed me Instead of asking you 'Nan can I go out? ' Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths I miss seeing a family, being a family And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer Family problems have never been funny In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia She took all our inheritance money Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces I never forgive the way she betrayed us. There ain't a big enough reason Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing But I guess that everyone's different Or should I say no one's perfect? She had happiness in front of her But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing. Since you gone the foundations crumbled So building it back up is my next step I got all the bricks and the cement but It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect So give me the strength that I need to perform this task Make it right, I must do And I ask cause I trust you It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you.  And of the pieces of my soul... (Because I need a sign I hope this pain will heal in time...) You know I never wanna be alo-oh-oh-one...  I can see the stars as a cold the wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh...  It's just for now so I should hush... I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but, I miss you... Ohh how I miss you... It's just for now so I should hush... I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but, I miss you... Ohh how I miss you...  There ain't enough words to describe How sorry I am for the pain that I caused Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood We were young and he said it was rapeing his broad And for the day police came to the door I'm sorry for being such a bad youth Stealing from your purse and making you mourn I never been able to say this before Cause I was so inconsiderate You loved me unconditionally And I took advantage of it like a idiot. Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with I really hope that you can forgive me You going away was a punishment But I won't let go I'm holding you with me But I still fight the emotions within me.  I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air And will you think of me up there? And can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face, Feel the chill of your warm embrace? And can I say goodbye to you?  I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air, And will you think of me up there? Can I say goodbye to you? And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face Or feel the chill of your warm embrace? Can I say goodbye to you...? |goodbye-to-you

   I wanna be drunk when I wake up On the right side of the wrong bed And never an excuse I made up Tell you the truth I hate What didn't kill me, It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your make up Lips sticks to me, so now I maybe lean back there I'm sat here wishing I was sober I know I'll never hold you like I used to  But a house gets cold when you cut the heating Without you to hold I'll be freezing Can't rely on my heart to beat in 'Cause you take parts of it every evening Take words out of my mouth just from breathing Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me? '  Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk again I'll be drunk again, I'll be drunk again To feel a little love  I wanna hold your heart in both hands Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can And I got no plans for the weekend, so should we speak then? Keep it between friends Though I know you'll never love me like you used to  There may be other people like us Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before And you don't hold me anymore  On cold days cold plays out like the band's name I know I can't heal things with a handshake You know I can change, as I began saying You cut me wide open like landscape Open bottles of beer but never champagne To applaud you with the sound that my hands make  Should I?

   I found your hair band on my bedroom floor The only evidence that you'd been here before And I don't get waves of missing you anymore They're more like tsunami tides In my eyes Never getting dry, So I get high, Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on Weeks pass in the blink of an eye And I'm still drunk at the end of the night  I don't drink like everybody else I do it to forget things about myself Stumble and fall With the head spin I got, My mind's with you but my heart's just not  So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out  That's why you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  Everybody said we'd be together forever, But I know that I never wanna settle down, Come around, break up the love like Lego now Never wanna turn into another like you Sleep with my thoughts And I dance with my views Everything's great, not everything's sure, But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus Now I'm in a position to be another stalker Like everything I say seems to all sound awkward Like our last kiss. It was perfect, But we were nervous on the surface And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it, Pain is only relevant if it still hurts I forget like an elephant Or we can use a sedative And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss  So am I close to you anymore if it's over? And there's no chance that we'll work it out  You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  Wo-ooooahhhh [2x] oohh ohh  Because if I was gonna go somewhere, I'd be there by now And maybe I can let myself down And I'm thinking that I'm unaware, I keep my feet on the ground And keep looking around To make sure I'm not the only one to feel low  Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered From all that I've done wrong And I know you'll say That I'm the only one, But I know God made another one of me to love you better than I ever will  'Cause you and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied You and I ended over U N I And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied |uni

   I should ink my skin with your name And take my passport out again And just replace it See I could do without a tan On my left hand, Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle And I should run you a hot bath And fill it up with bubbles  'Cause maybe you're lovable And maybe you're my snowflake When your eyes turn from green to gray In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place And you should never cut your hair 'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me? Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek 'Cause we've watched it 12 times But maybe you're hoping for a fairy tale too And if your DVD breaks today You should've got a VCR Because I've never owned a Blu-ray, true say  And now I've always been shit at computer games And your brother always beats me And if I lost, I'd go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me And be asking me If I'm gonna be home next week And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets  And you will never know Just how beautiful you are to me But maybe I'm just in love When you wake me up  And I think you hate the smell of smoke You always try get me to stop But you drink as much as me And I get drunk a lot So I'll take you to the beach And walk along the sand And I'll make you a heart pendant With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace So the heart falls where your chest is And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach And it falls just where it needs to be And rests peacefully So you just need to breathe To feel my heart against yours now, against yours now  'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up |wake-me-up

   This city never sleeps I hear the people walk by when itâs late Sirens bleed through my windowsill I canât close my eyes Donât control what Iâm into And this tower is alive The lights that blind keep me awake Hood up and lace untied The sleep fills my mind Can't control what Iâm into  London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home  Iâm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat Iâm blazing on the street What I do isnât up to you If the city never sleeps Then that makes two  The pavement is my friend It will take me where I need to go I find it trips me up And puts me down This is not what Iâm used to The shop across the road Fills my needs and gives me company When I need it Voices speak through my walls I donât think Iâm gonna make it Past tomorrow  London calls me a stranger, a traveller This is now my home, my home  Iâm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat Iâm blazing on the street What I do isnât up to you If the city never sleeps Then that makes two  And my lungs hurt And my ears bled With the sound of the city life Echoed in my head Do I need this to keep me alive? The traffic stops and starts But I need to move along  London calls me a stranger This is not my home, home  Iâm burning on the back street Stuck here sitting in the backseat Iâm blazing on the street What I do isnât up to you And if the city never sleeps Then that makes two |the-city

Float down Like autumn leaves And hush now Close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Ooh how I miss you My symphony played the song that carried you out Ooh how I miss you And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay  Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down Like autumn leaves And hush now Close your eyes before the sleep And you're miles away And yesterday you were here with me  Ooh oh, ooh oh Ooh oh, ooh oh  Touch down Like a seven four seven Stay out and we'll live forever now |autumn-leaves

  [Verse 1: Yelawolf] There wasn't much left Except for the last twenty sack And the last twenty of my last cheque I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step Woke up and took it in with a half breath Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick I lit my cigarette Feeling half dead, whisky on my mind Then came the dead Sherrif in the yard, here comes the rest I sat like a ghost, they all passed by My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye Baby in her arms She took a cab home She told me I was only good for a sad song A crooked smile I gave Nonchalant about it Maybe she'll come back This time I doubt it Act like I care, but I really don't Wanted to change But somehow I knew I really won't See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill And I never turned to church for a pray in hand God's not going to land another saving hand If the time came like it has time again Then I would watch the clock and be late again One gun and a harley in the driveway One way out, dirt road, pathway Put another dead butt in the ash tray I stand up still drunk, half baked Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring And through the fence I can see this little boy staring Paid him no attention In fact I barely seen him Until he walked away And he started singing...  [Hook: Ed Sheeran] London Bridge is falling down, falling down And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown Then we'll crash, crash, right down again Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  [Verse 2: Yelawolf] I didn't see it coming I didn't see the wall And I went from running, to a slow crawl I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie I speak no evil, but hear no angels A family is callin' but all I see is strangers Take the bible from the hotel drawer Hell froze over ice cold hell's door Knock knock I'm on the salt road non stop The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot And the gust of a dry summer Dirty water in the tap I think I found my number in the sand Right next to an empty can Old number seven, Jack is back again And the voice goes round and round And I would take the bridge But I can't forget the sound  [Hook: Ed Sheeran] London Bridge is falling down, falling down And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown Then we'll crash, crash, right down again Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  [Verse 3/Outro: Ed Sheeran] I'll be coming up when the sun goes down Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground Running from the law but I can't be found Only my God can track me down [x4]  And we'll crash, crash, right down again Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  I'll be coming up when the sun goes down Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground Running from the law but I can't be found Only my God can track me down [x2]  I'll be coming up when the sun goes down |london-bridge
  [Yelawolf] For fuck's sake  [Ed Sheeran] Living the life of a student Yeah, I begin on a high Losing my mind And they say that Iâve been winning for time Never been to a gun fight, never needed a knife But then I make the cut whenever delivering the lines Sit on the side, with a rhyme pad With a tin in my sights Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends Cause I paid in my pride Giving the time to write rhymes But I find truth at a quarter to five Eh  [Yelawolf] Itâs kinda like I took a train To the left side of my brain, oh, mayne Toddle some mud, under my door You know Iâm stepping in my own lane All of these speakers sitting behind me But what psychology, psychologically insane Part of me wanna get down, down, down Making you go low, inside  [Ed Sheeran] You donât know, if you donât know by now You better tell him âbout it What you gonna tell him bout it? Yeah, yeaaaah  [Yelawolf] Ten toes to the dirt Pencil to the paper God has a favour for your thirst Drink-drink ya pint bye-bye To this bullshit praise allah To the wheels Iâm a ridah Steering your prada Only closed in my ada-di-das Iâm a fetus in my boom sake nana Daddyâs home, on the mic, hey papa  [Ed Sheeran] Back with my bang yo, straight loop on my pedal no band though But every single one of my fans know that Every damn show, Iâm taking their ears on a journey Like Iâm flying overseas with Van Gogh Livinâ so sweet without Gretel and Hansel Critics hate the lyrics cause they think Iâve been tangoed Find me wearing old clothes rocking a Kangol Iâm riding round with Yelawolf in your daddyâs Lambo  [Yelawolf] Hello me, how ya been? You got a mullet again like when you was 10 Youâre probably sipping sweet teeâs, you still huh? And your piggy bank is full of change Fact, what you used to steal from You been playing fools, like a steel drum Pulling out early, and they still come Eating from the game, when you know the mealâs done Yelawolf is kicking back at these pilgrims Hold up baby, sit still son Woah, this old rock, it heals been rolled Still shocking when I see âem go Bananas and they hammer the [?]  [Hook]  [Yelawolf] Iâm not the average half wit After this hour gets out of this 60 seconds Iâm going in any directions And chasing this jack with a shot of Budweiser and water Itâs probably the better idea you move the direction in Fact its a part of me to be the looser of cannons Blowing his fucking mics like the winds  I caught this cardigan Hooligans, hooligans, hooligans But really whoâs a friend? Jump in this little fire jump right back in the pool again Know I be new again A student of you my friend Marshall Mathers, Iâm tossing rappers up at my crew of 10 Minus 4, minus war You donât want it Shady records Iâm already better, fuck it, doggonnit  Dog donât gotta lead Dogâs already home Jack, dog Iâm a beast, Iâm a wolf Bring your dogs back A melody man in a melancholic mellow yellow can Shhh, tell him how we gonna sell âem man  Been working hard all week (So if you wonder if we earned it, well its not a probably) So wonât you bring that back to me (And holla when you hear it like all the screams of a halloween) I got blisters on my feet (To walk in night with you is not the shoes to be borrowing) So wonât you bring that back to me (Cause all the sole of my pin is what all the sorrow brings)  If you donât know, if you donât know, no, no, no If you donât know, if you donât know, no, no, no If you donât know, if you donât know, no, no, no If you donât know, if you donât know, no, no, no |you-dont-know-for-fucks-sake

Obvious Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's several pauses You might need a coffin with holes on the top of these tubes to receive oxygen You buried alive like a freak, six feet Clawing and snatching and clawin' like a cat And a dog and a rat And a hog in a pen With a frog and all there is to eat Is frog and they Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth and jaws and then They fight to the death for at least a piece off of them See that you back to bars again, he's all asleep in coffin, man Iâm all, they all thatâs been, ever was at the start of it You mention the squad and then You mention the god of pens Not of it, but I'm harder then Flesh Iâm harder than titanium brass plates that are polished in Sticking emcees off like a fly trap, or a bobby pin When I rap Iâm astonishing I attack tracks like a train track strapped to a bomb and send Shockwaveâs that's what I made, got this bastard popping then I spit on my pop's grave without apologin' Take shits on shih tzus Pisses on igloos Throw it up to the whole fucking world, it's sick too Vomitin' stomach fluid like you just ate shit stew Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?

"   Ah lahmlahlah Ah lahmlahlah  I met this girl late last year She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear."" I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jump right in A week later returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend. Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00. Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin. We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM. Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said."" She's singing Ah lahmlahlah  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah  And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her We drink away the days with a take-away pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha All over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either But me and her we make money the same way Four cities, two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch But we should get on a plane Or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down The way that things played out When she was kissing him How I was confused about Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing Ah lahmlahlah  Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah  [Knock knock knock] on my hotel door I don't even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all And I never saw him as a threat Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun and I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest And all this time God knows I'm singing Ah lahmlahlah  [2x:] Don't fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my home I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah Don't fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I don't wanna know that babe Ah lahmlahlah "|dont
   I met you when I was a teen But then you were one as well And I could play a guitar Just like ringing a bell Sometimes I wonder In any other summer Could you have been my part-time lover to me Listening to Stevie Wonder Under the covers where we used to lay And Re: Stacks is what the speakers played I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe We used each other's air just for the people to see And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep We'd go anywhere our minds would take us And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause We can all be loved the way that God made us And time's the only reason that we could break up 'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again  Oh Nina, you should go Nina 'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina Oh won't you leave me now And I've been livin' on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina 'Cause that's you and me both Nina Oh won't you leave me now, now  And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own 'Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits Acting as if we were two rabbits And then you'd vanish Back to the borough with all the Celtics I disappear, you call me selfish I understand but I can't help it I put my job over everything except my family and friends But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back Overlook the situation 'cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane But in a day we'll have to say it again  Oh Nina, you should go Nina 'Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina Oh won't you leave me now And I've been livin' on the road Nina But then again you should know Nina 'Cause that's you and me both Nina Oh won't you leave me now, now  Love will come and love will go But you can make it on your own Sing that song Go oh won't you leave me now People grow and fall apart But you can mend your broken heart Take it back go oh won't you leave me now  [2x] Oh Nina, you should go Nina (Love will come and love will go) Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina (But you can make it on your own) Oh won't you leave me now (Sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now) And I've been livin' on the road Nina (People grow and fall apart) But then again you should know Nina (But you can mend your broken heart) Cause that's you and me both Nina (Take it back, go oh won't you leave me now) Oh won't you leave me now now |nina

   No, I don't wanna hate you Just wish you'd never gone for the man And waited two weeks at least Before you let him take you I stayed true I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school He's waiting for the time to move I knew he had his eyes on you He's not the right guy for you Don't hate me cause I write the truth No I would never lie to you But it was never fine to lose you And what a way to find out It never came from my mouth You never changed your mind But you were just afraid to mind out But fuck it, I won't be changing the subject I love it I'll make your little secret public it's nothing I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me Trapped and I'm lacking sleep Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually You're practically my family If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot I think not  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  Recently I tend to zone out Up in my headphones to Holocene You promised your body but I'm away so much I stay more celibate than in a monastery I'm not cut out for life on the road Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much And at the time we'd just go, so sue me I guess I'm not the man that you need Ever since you went to uni I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad But when I broke the industry That's when I broke your heart I was supposed to chart and celebrate But good things are over fast I know it's hard to deal with and see this I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus I never really want to believe this Got advice from my dad and he Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore  And since you left I've given up my days off It's what I need to stay strong I know you have a day job But mine is 24/7 I feel like writing a book I guess I lied in the hook Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could The irony is if my career and music didn't exist In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27 I'll die from a thrill Go down in history as just a wasted talent Can I face the challenge Or did I make a mistake erasing? It's only therapy My thoughts just get ahead of me Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit Take my apology I'm sorry for the honesty But I had to get this off my chest  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't want you no Anymore  I don't love you baby I don't need you baby I don't wanna love you no Anymore |the-man

   I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten 'Cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm Prisoner with a vision Signs of a label But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't So perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system And you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga We drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I do my own thing now And get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded Like a paper weight At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked Went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star And adding to the population Not my imagination I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?

   It's just another night And I'm staring at the moon I saw a shooting star And thought of you I sang a lullaby By the waterside and knew If you were here I'd sing to you You're on the other side As the skyline splits in two Miles away from seeing you  But I can see the stars from America I wonder, do you see them too?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  I can hear your heart On the radio beat They're playing 'Chasing Cars' And I thought of us Back to the time You were lying next to me I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand Back through lamp-lit streets and knew Everything led back to you  So can you see the stars over Amsterdam? Hear the song my heart is beating to?  So open your eyes and see The way our horizons meet And all of the lights will lead Into the night with me And I know these scars will bleed But both of our hearts believe All of these stars will guide us home  And, oh, I know And oh, I know, oh And I know oh oh oh  I can see the stars from America |all-of-the-stars

But, mum, there's a tear every time that I blink  Oh, I'm in pieces. It's tearing me up but I know A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved  So, I'll sing Hallelujah, You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go And when God takes you back He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home.""  I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case John said he'd drive, then put his hand on my cheek And wiped a tear from the side of my face  And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know A life with love is a life that's been lived  So, I'll sing Hallelujah, You were an angel in the shape of my mum When I fell down you'd be there holding me up Spread your wings as you go, when God takes you back He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home.""

   Goodbye Norma Jeane Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled They crawled out of the woodwork And they whispered into your brain They set you on the treadmill And they made you change your name  And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did  Loneliness was tough The toughest role you ever played Hollywood created a superstar And pain was the price you paid Even when you died Oh the press still hounded you All the papers had to say Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did  Goodbye Norma Jeane Though I never knew you at all You had the grace to hold yourself While those around you crawled Goodbye Norma Jeane From the young man in the 22nd row Who sees you as something more than sexual More than just our Marilyn Monroe  And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never knowing who to cling to When the rain set in And I would've liked to have known you But I was just a kid Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did Your candle burned out long before Your legend ever did |candle-in-the-wind-2018-version

   We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been. We just try to keep those secrets in a lie, And if they find out, will it all go wrong? And Heaven knows, no one wants it to.  So I could take the back road But your eyes will lead me straight back home. And if you know me like I know you You should love me, you should know.  Friends just sleep in another bed, And friends don't treat me like you do. Well I know that there's a limit to everything, But my friends won't love me like you. No, my friends won't love me like you.  We're not friends, we could be anything. If we try to keep those secrets safe. No one will find out if it all went wrong. They'll never know what we've been through.  So I could take the back road, But your eyes'll lead me straight back home. And if you know me like I know you, You should love me, you should know.  Friends just sleep in another bed, And friends don't treat me like you do. Well I know that there's a limit to everything, But my friends won't love me like you. No, my friends won't love me like you.  But then again, if we're not friends, Someone else might love you too. And then again, if we're not friends, There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why  Friends should sleep in other beds. And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do. And I know that there's a limit to everything. But my friends won't love me like you. No, my friends won't love me like you do. Oh, my friends will never love me like you. |friends

I feel love in this Newfoundland flat Only God knows where I found it at Maybe faith pulled me into the pub Just to meet someone who'd give me their love I just liked how you kissed me like that  Never thought I'd be taking you home I assumed I'd be sleeping alone Apologies for the mess that I made I wasn't expecting you to stay at my place What a beautiful way to start this  And I've got a t-shirt you can wear And just a blanket that we both could share Not the fanciest place, but it's home  Down in this downtown apartment Is where two broken hearts went To see what it feels like to fall for a stranger Caught in a landslide of something Darling I might ask you one thing Is this what it feels like to fall for a stranger?

   I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in I never want to get bitten Cause plagiarism is hidden Watch how I sit on the rhythm Prisoner with a vision Signs of a label But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't So perk your ears up and listen Studio is a system And you could say that I'm driven And now it's onto the next saga We drink the best lager I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather I do my own thing now And get respect after And I'm avoiding the 'caine Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded Like a paper weight At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked Went from sleeping at a subway station To sleeping with a movie star And adding to the population Not my imagination I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  I take it back with the rhythm and blues With my rap pack I'll be singing the news Tryin' act like Jack Black When I bring it to school I make a beat with my feet By just hittin' the loop Bringing the lyrics to prove That I can fit in these shoes I give you the truth through the vocal booth And stars burst out on the scene Like an opal fruit They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot But then again that's what they're supposed to do And I'm supposed to be calm I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm Whispering everything that happens Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song Since they are claiming I handled it wrong But then I've never had an enemy Except the NME but I'll be selling Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be With only spectacles ahead of me And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet I take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No And take it back now  Now I don't ever wanna be perfect Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition 'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written Now absence can make your heart ache But drinking absinth can change your mind state Vividly need to let my liver be And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me And I hope to see him blowing up globally 'Cause that how it's supposed to be I'm screaming out vocally It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams But, but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of McDaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out It's time to take it back now  Mmmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  Mmm come on and take it back love Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love No  Very superstitious, writings on the wall,  Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall,  Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass  Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past  Believing things that you don't understand,  Then you suffer,  Superstition ain't the way  Superstition ain't the way  Superstition ain't the way  Superstition ain't the way  Superstition ain't the way   My dreams keep me awake at night Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype Am I just living the lie With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake But the other 10 per cent it never fades Dreaming dreams, day to day goals Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up And just remember just to hold out more A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought You'd find me buskin' on the street When it was cold outdoors And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour Writing love songs for the sake of it Never to make a hit You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is Dreams you own, just set your goals And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha.

   I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,  Never been known as my government name, My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain, And now you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with nothing on me but power and glory,  And surely you'll never ignore me, 'cause when the the call came The court date was made to disappear for me, You think you understand me but never what I went through But you were never meant to I won't hold it against you,  I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in my forearms, Forget me not never let me stop You'll just sit and watch it's your job to be patient so you'll let me off,  So come with me take a walk on the wild side, See life in a day through a child's eyes, And these dreams are all I have to hold me, When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away,  Okay, session's over time to get back to the classroom, I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too, You told me I should try my best but guess what? I still find this trigonometry a head fuck,  Constantly told I won't pass my GCSE's, I'll end up in Micky D's serving burgers and cheese, But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it, Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,  Lately classmates think I'm crazy, turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey, And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it Without new clothes or shower it hard to do, So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home,  So come with me take a walk on the wild side See life in a day through a child's eyes, And these dreams are all I have, to hold me, When sleep's the only thing that I want to take me away, away. |these-dreams

   Oh the summer time is coming And the trees are sweetly blooming Where the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather Would you go, lassie, go?  And we'll all go together Where the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather Would you go, lassie, go?  And I will build my love a bower  And yon pure crystal fountain And around it I will place All the colors of the mountain Would you go, lassie, go?  And we'll all go together Where the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather Would you go, lassie, go?  And If my true love's gone I will surely find another And to her I will sing Things that make her know I want her  Would you go, lassie, go? And we'll all go together Where the wild mountain thyme Grows around blooming heather  Would you go, lassie, go? |wild-mountain-thyme
   So, so you think you can tell Heaven from Hell, Blue skies from pain. Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?  Did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts? Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze? Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange A walk on part in the war For a lead role in a cage?  How I wish, how I wish you were here. We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl, Year after year, Running over the same old ground. What have we found? The same old fears. Wish you were here. |wish-you-were-here
